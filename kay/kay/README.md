PROJECT 2 - GEEKSHUBSACADEMY - RESTAURANT WEBSITE DESIGNED WITH HTML, CSS AND BOOTSTRAP COMPONENENTS

This was my second project for Geekshubs academy. The purpose was to design a responsive website for a fictional restaurant which contained a menu.

We were supposed to demonstrate an understanding of various elements of front end web development that we have studied up to now, so to that end were told to make the website 

with HTML, CSS and to include Bootstrap elements. I also imported a Google font for the website.

My restaurant is called 'The English Restaurant' and is structured as follows:

Welcome Page:

Contains a photograph of the restaurant, an interactive contact form, a paragraph advertising the restaurant and a list detailing who the restaurant caters for.

Menu:

Made with bootstrap. Contains a beakfast, lunch and dinner option with description of food and prices.

Gallery :

A collection of photographs of dishes which are served in the restaurant.

Contact:

Contains a fictional address and contact number, an interactive email and message form, and a photograph of the restaurant.
